# Security Audit Report

## Executive Summary

This report presents a comprehensive security audit of the sleep apnea detection repository. The audit examined potential security vulnerabilities, including token/API key leaks, insecure coding practices, and configuration issues.

## Overall Security Assessment

**Overall Risk Level: LOW-MEDIUM**

The repository demonstrates good security practices in most areas, with proper environment variable usage and secure HTTPS connections. However, there are some areas that require attention.

## Detailed Findings

### 1. Token and API Key Management ✅ **GOOD**

**Status**: Properly secured
- The repository correctly uses environment variables for sensitive credentials
- `NSRR_TOKEN` is loaded from `.env` file using `os.environ["NSRR_TOKEN"]`
- The `.gitignore` file properly excludes `.env` files from version control
- No hardcoded API keys, tokens, or secrets were found in the codebase

**Code Reference**:
```python
# sleep-project/sleepdataspo2/process.py:127
token=os.environ["NSRR_TOKEN"],
```

### 2. SSL/TLS Configuration ✅ **GOOD**

**Status**: Secure
- All HTTP requests use HTTPS (`https://sleepdata.org`)
- SSL verification is properly enabled using `certifi.where()` for certificate validation
- No insecure SSL configurations (verify=False) were found

**Code Reference**:
```python
# sleep-project/sleepdataspo2/download_data.py:54
with session.get(download_url, stream=True, params=params, verify=certifi.where(), timeout=60) as response:
```

### 3. Input Validation and Sanitization ✅ **GOOD**

**Status**: Secure
- No evidence of SQL injection vulnerabilities (no direct SQL queries found)
- No dangerous functions like `eval()`, `exec()`, or `os.system()` in use
- Input validation is handled through argument parsing

### 4. Dependency Management ⚠️ **MEDIUM RISK**

**Status**: Requires attention
- The project uses `pickle` for serialization, which can be a security risk if loading untrusted data
- However, the pickle usage appears to be commented out in the current codebase

**Code Reference**:
```python
# sleep-project/sleepdataspo2/run_pipeline.py:11
import pickle
# Lines 46-49 are commented out but show pickle usage
```

**Recommendation**: If pickle is needed, ensure only trusted data is deserialized.

### 5. HTTP Request Security ✅ **GOOD**

**Status**: Secure
- Uses proper retry mechanisms with exponential backoff
- Implements timeout configurations (60 seconds)
- Uses session management for connection pooling
- No insecure HTTP endpoints found

### 6. File Permissions ✅ **GOOD**

**Status**: Secure
- All Python files have appropriate permissions (644 - readable by owner/group, not executable)
- No overly permissive file permissions detected

### 7. Debug Information ⚠️ **LOW RISK**

**Status**: Minor concern
- Debug print statements are present in the code but don't expose sensitive information
- These are used for logging data processing steps

### 8. Environment Configuration ✅ **GOOD**

**Status**: Secure
- Proper use of `.env` files for configuration
- `.gitignore` properly excludes sensitive files (*.env, *.pem, etc.)
- No hardcoded credentials in configuration files

## Recommendations

### High Priority
1. **Consider pickle alternatives**: If serialization is needed, consider using safer alternatives like JSON or protocol buffers for untrusted data.

### Medium Priority
1. **Add input validation**: Implement additional input validation for file paths and user inputs to prevent path traversal attacks.
2. **Implement logging**: Add proper logging instead of print statements for better security monitoring.

### Low Priority
1. **Code cleanup**: Remove commented-out pickle code if it's not needed.
2. **Add security headers**: If this code is used in a web context, consider adding security headers.

## Positive Security Practices Observed

1. **Proper secret management**: Using environment variables for sensitive data
2. **Secure communication**: All external communications use HTTPS
3. **Certificate validation**: Proper SSL certificate verification
4. **Version control hygiene**: Sensitive files are properly excluded from git
5. **No hardcoded credentials**: All sensitive information is externalized

## Conclusion

The repository demonstrates good security practices overall. The main concerns are relatively minor, and the codebase appears to be developed with security in mind. The proper use of environment variables for sensitive data and secure HTTPS connections are particularly commendable.

The repository is suitable for production use with the implementation of the recommended security improvements.
